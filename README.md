### What are we going to craft?

Especially since the Covid outbreak, we're all using streaming services such as Spotify, Netflix, Disney+, or even Popcorn Time. We book our holidays on internet with AirBnb, we play games through elaborate clients such as Steam, we care about meaningful reviews on Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB, we can even shop NFTs on online platforms like we would in an art gallery, and many other things...

The common denominator of all those services they all feature a unified stream of content, a collection of some sort. In this challenge we are going to split up the work in two parts to try to replicate this.

## Gathering some informations

The first mission was to gather a list (Array) of things I like, i had to choose between all of these examples :

- Music
- Video games
- Movies or series
- Books
- Paintings
- Football players (like those old Panini collectables)
- Recipes

i choosed to make a list of musical themes

### Properties

For each of these item i had to find relevant information about it (Properties). For example if i wanted to make a movie collection, i could come up with :

    The movie title
    Its release date
    Its director
    Some cast members
    A (or multiple) genre(s)
    A short description of the movie
    A link to the trailer
    A picture

i needed at least 5 properties for each object in my Array!

## Instruction for the exercice

with this kind of js obect :

```
const collection = [
{
name: "Pulp Fiction",
director: "Quentin Tarantino",
releaseYear: 1994,
picture: "link/to/a/picture",
genre: ["Crime", "Drama"],
cast: [
"John Travolta",
"Samuel L Jackson",
"Uma Thurman",
"Amanda Plummer",
],
},

// ...
];
```

i had to create cards for each objects who had their own properties and create my design using css and responsiveness
